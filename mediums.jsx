// 1. Container with Most Water (easy)

// You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

// Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

// Return the maximum amount of water a container can store

// Input: height = [1,1]
// Output: 1

//strategy: find the highest and second highest heights in the array
// but then there could be long and short ones?
// no
